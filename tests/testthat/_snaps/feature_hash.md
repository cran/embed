# basic usage

    Code
      res_te <- bake(rec_tr, te_dat, dplyr::starts_with("x3"))
    Condition
      Warning:
       There was 1 column that was a factor when the recipe was prepped:
       'x3'.
       This may cause errors when processing new data.

# can prep recipes with no keep_original_cols

    Code
      rec_trained <- prep(rec, training = ex_dat, verbose = FALSE)
    Condition
      Warning:
      'keep_original_cols' was added to `step_feature_hash()` after this recipe was created.
      Regenerate your recipe to avoid this warning.

# check_name() is used

    Code
      prep(rec, training = dat)
    Condition
      Error in `step_feature_hash()`:
      Caused by error in `check_name()`:
      ! Name collision occured in `step_feature_hash`. The following variable names already exists: x3_hash_01.
